            <li>3 medium zucchinis, sliced</li>
            <li>2 medium onions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>Â½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Toss zucchinis and onions in a large bowl with olive oil until evenly coated. Spread vegetables into a large baking dish.</li>
            <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Heat marinara sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until sauce is hot. Spread hot marinara sauce into the prepared baking dish, followed by penne pasta and zucchini mixture. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese atop vegetables.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow casserole to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
